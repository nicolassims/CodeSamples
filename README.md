# Code Samples
### A collection of samples of code, in multiple different languages, that show what I can do.

#### Contents

**C#: An object-oriented programming language. C# is based on C++ and contains features similar to those of Java.**  
>Laser.cs: A script similar to the one I wrote when under the employ of [Biogen](https://www.biogen.com/). Contains a class that allows a laser pointer to be used in a virtual reality space.

>TennisApp.cs: A class that contains a function that, upon given a set of scores in a tennis game, will output a score declaring the state of the game from among ~9 options.

**C++: A general-purpose programming language. An extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".**  
>CardGame.cpp: A couple of classes defining a player, a card, and a deck, that could be used in card-game-like programs.

**GML: An imperative, dynamically typed language commonly likened to JavaScript and C-like languages.**  
>BattleStep.gml: A script written for [Antiem](https://freudiancreations.website/projects/antiem). Is the "step" event for an object, executing every frame. This object runs a turn-based battle system.

**Python: An interpreted, dynamically-typed programming language. It emphasizes readability.**  
>crawl.rpy: A script written for an unfinished project. Runs a "dungeon crawling" system where players can move around on a map, interact with nodes, and be blocked by walls. Uses a system whereby it can be fed text files and create maps of them.
